First of all, I really would like to thank you 
for giving me this opportunity and I really 
appreciate for your time.  
I am excited to be here. 
I have been in IT industry for 5 years . 
Within that time I have gained domain knowledge 
in different sectors such as Logistics and Retail.
After spending a lot of time in the Agile environment, 
I have a strong understanding of the Software Development 
and Testing Lifecycle and have become proficient with 
testing frameworks, automation tools and agile practices.
Currently, I am working as an QA Automation Engineer 
within my team. My main responsibilities are to design, 
develop and maintain the Test Automation Framework 
that verifies user stories and system requirements. 
For that purpose I am implementing functional, 
smoke and regression tests.
I have tested Web Based applications by implementing 
for Front-end testing, Selenium webDriver, Junit, 
TestNG, Cucumber BDD framework using Java programing language.
For Back-End Testing: JDBC for dataBase testing, 
Rest-Assured for API testing.
For manual verification I use Postman and Oracle DB.
As a person, I consider myself a positive person,
a cross-functional team member, detail oriented 
and Quick learner at my professional life. 
I feel very comfortable adapting to new environments. 
Iâ€™m looking for a new challenge and taking my career 
to the next level, with a competitive company like yours. 
That's pretty much about me.
